## General Info
  Translation
  * A translation is one of the most basic transformation, so they are conform with the Euclidean interpretation of geometry

  Rotation
  * As again indicated by the index E of H this transformations also conforms to
   Euclidean metrics.

  Points
  * Points in the three-dimensional projective space are described by a 4-vector of homogeneous coordinates

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Matlab R2016b
	


## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using Matlab R2016b
